  @Vaibhav - Comments on the demo site are powered by
  [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) that generates `_data` files for each. You
  can read the theme's docs on [how to set it
  up](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#static-based-comments-via-staticman)
  and check out a more detailed post on my site explaining [how it all
  works](https://mademistakes.com/articles/jekyll-static-comments/).
